    <h3>Bio</h3>
    <p>
        If you're here to learn a little about me, hello! My name is Robert, I'm originally from Round Lake Beach, 
        Illinois, but now I live in beautiful Grand Lake, Colorado! Currently for work, I'm a ski / bike patroller 
        providing basic EMS to anyone who may need it. I've always had an interest in Software Development, as well 
        as coding in general. 
    </p>
    <p>
        My interest for coding first started back in 2008, when I discovered a game called Roblox. Essentially, Roblox 
        is somewhat of a game engine, (more so now than it was back then), that primarily had you develop with Lua. 
        Since then, I've spent a lot of time toying around with other languages like C#, Python, C++, C, and HTML, and 
        I finally decided it's time for me to commit to the bit and begin my journey down this career path. 
    </p>

    <h3>Goals for the Year</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Become proficient in at least <em>three</em> full stacks.</li>
        <li>Build my confidence in selling myself and begin the application process.</li>
        <li>Once more comfortable, begin work on my old passion project: creating my own, open source framework for banking apps.</li>
        <li>Begin my career as a full stack software developer.</li>
        <li>Continue to find ways to learn everyday, and hopefully spread the knowledge I gain.</li>
    </ul>
